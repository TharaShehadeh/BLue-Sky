* Sprint1 Tasks Estimation :
-------------------------------------
17 tasks are expected to be done by the team.

* sprint1 Re-estimation :
------------------------------------- 
the reservation process is supposed to be done in this sprint ,but because the reversation process is too long ,part of it has been completed and the rest has been postponed.

* sprint1 Last 24 hours:
------------------------------------- 
In the last 24 hours, the team met with the customer to present what has been accomplished and receive any modification he wants. It was agreed to complete part of the booking process and postpone the other part of it for the next sprint, which led to relieving the development team's workload.

* sprint1 Next 24 hours :
------------------------------------- 
We have increased the number of development team members to complete the tasks faster and then present them to the customer and get feedback,And give the team tasks for the next stage.


* sprint1 Impediments :
------------------------------------- 
We faced some difficulties in dealing with the development tools, due to the different versions of programs for each member of the development team, and that was the reason that led to the failure to complete all the required tasks on time, and there is another problem, which is the absence of one of the team members due to a health problem.In addition to the lack of time and the large number of tasks.
